UniCourse is an Education System that connects teachers and students through the Web application and the Android App. It is designed to solve the problem that conventional ways of communication between teachers and university students such as emails and office hours are not satisfying in terms of efficiency.

This project started in May, 2013 and it was funded by the Chinese National Undergraduate Innovation Program. While acting as team leader, I designed the interactions and graphic interfaces of six modules for the Web and Android Applications. I also developed the backend of notification module using PHP during the summer of 2013.
